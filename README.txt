
Q) MultiThreading in Java

Java is a multi-threaded programming language which means we can develop multi-threaded program using Java. 
A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle a different task at the same time making optimal
use of the available resources specially when your computer has multiple CPUs.

Multi-threading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed concurrently in the same program.
